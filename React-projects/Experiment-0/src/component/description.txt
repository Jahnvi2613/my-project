Created a reusable React component named ProductCard to display product details such as product name, price, and stock status.
Used props to pass data from the parent component (App.js) to the child component (ProductCard). This allowed us to render multiple products dynamically without rewriting the component code.
Implemented the ProductCard.js file to accept three props (name, price, status) and display them clearly inside a styled box (card layout).
In App.js, imported ProductCard and used it multiple times with different product data, demonstrating reusability and dynamic rendering.
Applied Flexbox styling to align the product cards horizontally, add spacing between them, and place them inside a bordered container.
Added a heading "Products List" to the container for clarity and structure.
Verified the output where three product cards were displayed neatly:
Wireless Mouse → $25.99 → In Stock
Keyboard → $45.50 → Out of Stock
Monitor → $199.99 → In Stock
Practiced combining React concepts (props) with CSS styling to achieve a clean, professional UI.
